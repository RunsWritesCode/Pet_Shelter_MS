Discworld Animal Shelter

This project was completed in week 5 of CodeClan's software development course. It was a solo project completed in 7 days. The broad remit was to develop a software management system for a pet shelter.


Getting Started

Download this code and in the main directory:

createdb pet_shelter

psql -d deal_tracker -f db/deal_tracker.sql

ruby db/seeds.rb

Then run the app:

ruby app.rb

To open in browser:

http://localhost:4567

Check out that delete button... I added this feature after looking at the Office of National Statistics data on volunteering and considered that the main users would be younger women and retirees.
